So not sure how down you are to read a book right now, but I've just stumbled across a book via listening to a podcast. I didn't have any real intention of dedicating a whole page to books, but I want to drop this information right here. I only have one book suggestion at the moment, maybe I will find more. 

The following book is from actress Kristen Johnston on her addiction to pain medication:

* [Guts: The Endless Follies and Tiny Triumphs of a Giant Disaster](https://www.amazon.com/Guts-Endless-Follies-Triumphs-Disaster-ebook/dp/B005GG0M9M)

If you don't feel like sitting down and reading through a book yourself you can find it on [audible](https://www.audible.com/) which is a way to listen to audio books. You can get the first month for free. You can listen in the car on your way to and from work, or maybe before bed to fall asleep to. 

I don't know if this book is really any good, but it has pretty good reviews.
