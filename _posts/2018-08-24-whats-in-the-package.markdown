If you've made it to this page, it means you've received and opened your (self)care-package I sent you. There weren't too many things inside of it, but let's break down what you found inside.

## Gurl, you gotta eat ##

That's as simple as it is. I sent you some Special-K bars because Mom and Dad said you really like them, so please take them to work and eat them, and let it be a reminder that you need to eat food. *Take your breaks*. Your job is **not** more important than your personal health. I don't care how stressful it might be, or what consequences might result from it, but you need to take 30 minutes each day to leave your job and eat some food. (And drink water.)

## We are the crystal gems ##

No you don't watch Steven Universe, but it has a [cute intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSaoXwQzHnY) (<-- This is what a link looks like, they will pop up frequently, I can assure you. Go ahead and click on it.) 

Okay, so crystals seem kind of cheesy and ridiculous, but they can have significant impacts on your life. Crystals have been scientifically proven to be really good conductors and transducers of energy, in a literal sense. They are used in our technology to send electrical signals from one place to another. 

Some people believe this energy can expand beyond the physical applications into the spiritual realm. (Stay with me.) People believe that certain crystals can help to harness specific energies within and around one's self. Now regardless of whether or not this is true, I have found that crystals can stand as a physical reminder of things you might want to focus on inside of yourself.

For example, I wear a rose quartz (see right) around my neck and almost always carry carnelian (see below) with me in my pockets. Rose quartz is the love stone, it should help you to love others (friends, family, and yourself) as well as help draw love *from* others. Carnelian is good for balancing your sexual energy and for helping to give you self-confidence. Obviously, these stones work well together.

You see, personally, my greatest struggle is that of lonliness. The longer I am alone, the more hopeless I get and struggle to believe that one day I will **not** be alone. So these stones remind me, where ever I go, to treat others (as well as myself) with love and compassion, to have confidence in myself, and to have faith that my person will come along. And who knows? Maybe my rose quartz will draw them to me.

Inside your box you will see a small piece of [rose quartz](https://www.energymuse.com/rose-quartz-meaning), two [clear quartz](https://www.energymuse.com/clearquartz-meaning) points, a large chunk of [onyx](https://www.energymuse.com/onyx-meaning), and some [kunzite](https://www.crystalvaults.com/crystal-encyclopedia/kunzite). I slipped a pamphlet inside that should help you to identify what these stones can do for you. 

Read more about crystals [here](https://www.energymuse.com/). Different places say different things, so I just look for information that tends to overlap.

## Gratitude ##
Gratitude! The single word that has most impacted my life in the past eight months. As you know it was so impactful that I got it tattooed on my body. 

Inside your package you will find a fun new journal that I took the liberty of decorating with the word "Gratitude". 

At the end of *most* days (some days I forget) I sit down and jot down three things that I am Grateful for that day. It is my intent that you might start practicing the same routine. 

Some days, I am angry and dissapointed with the world, and I would rather die than write in my "stupid" Gratitude journal. I find that it is on these days that I *most* need to find the time to sit down and do it.

There are studies that show the happiest people in the world practice two things: gratitude, and savory. Now I don't know any techniques on how to savor your life more (eat your chocolate more slowly?), but the journal does help to increase your gratitude for life.

Now is a good time for me to introduce you to Medium. I will write another post about the publication website but for right now here are a couple articles that might be relevant to your new Gratitude journal.
