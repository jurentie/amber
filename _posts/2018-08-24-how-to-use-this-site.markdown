## Use at your liesure ##
Okay, I am *well* aware that you do not like reading. So this might all be a bit over-bearing for me to start throwing a ton of reading material at you. I'm going to be writing several posts for ideas and resources I think could benefit you and then I will probably be linking to a ton of other articles and sources out on the internet that will require even *more* reading. 

Don't get overwhelmed here. I told you that most of this stuff I use on a daily basis. Maybe I read one article on any given morning, or end my evening with a good inspirational TED talk. You don't have to bust through any of this in a day. In fact, it is probably going to benefit you more if you come back to this site anytime you feel like you **need** it. 

I do think it would be worth your while to get through these first three posts, however. These first three posts are meant to be a sort of introduction. 

## Go through the posts ##
I've numbered these posts and hopefully you started by reading in order I-III. I've created a few introductory posts, and from there on I will have posts with links and resources and tips and guides and yadda yadda yadda. Go through these however you'd like. 

## Resources ##
At the top of this page you will find a resources tab where I plan on compiling all the different resources I point you to across these different posts. That way it will be easy to see any article or video you might have watched without having to sift through all this information again.

That's about it! `Home` page has all the posts. `Resources` has a list of all the resources for you. Read at your own pace and again, I hope this helps :)
