The purpose of this blog is to document the things I've learned either through work or through my own personal projects.

I am using this blog as an opportunity to help myself get better at documenting code and communicating complicated concepts to others. By documenting information I am also ensuring that I have a better understanding. This blog will mostly focus on Java/Python, though I may write the occasional post on topics learned from my time working as a web developer intern, HTML/CSS and JavaScript primarily. I've also been working to better understand Blockchain/Bitcoin/Ethereum, and plan on documenting any information learned in these areas.

By no means am I claiming to be an expert in any of these topics. Most of the information I gather and document will most likely be easily found in other parts of the internet. As I mention above the main focus of this blog is to help myself get better at coding and documenting, and also act as a source of reference to return to in future. Regardless, I hope this blog can act as a source of information and learning for myself, as well as others. Thank you for checking out this blog, I hope you enjoy it as I develop it further.
