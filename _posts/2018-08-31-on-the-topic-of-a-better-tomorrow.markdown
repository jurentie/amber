Okay. So now I've given you all these fun things to go look at and explore and that's all fine and dandy, but as great as some of the resources are, you might need to consider more concrete option for holding yourself accountable and for getting *real* help.

As you know I go to see a therapist 2 to 4 times every month. I don't even know if I can afford it when I go, but I know I need it. Ya boi is going to see a psychiatrist at the end of September. I know I need help, and I work my butt off to make sure I receive it.

So here are some potential resources for you to look into if you would like to receive some more professional help.

## Ideas for Healthy Recovery ##

1. Yoga! I've done yoga a few times in my life, and I always feel better, mentally and physically. Something I've recently learned about but haven't actually tried is Theraputic Yoga. It's yoga that addresses addiction and depression. Yoga in general strives to create internal peace and helps people find meaning in their life. 
2. Go for a run. Recently I've learned that running can be a really great trick for tackling anxiety. I don't know about you, but when I get a bout of anxiety I feel very antsy and my adrenaline seems raised. A great solution is to just take the natural fuel your body is creating and put it to use. A friend of mine told me that they would run *anytime* they felt an anxiety attack come on. Didn't matter if it was midnight or the middle of the day, just hop up and run and you will most likely feel settled down after.
3. Finances. This is something I addressed with you already. I know you just purchased a car (good job!), but if you wanted to look at your finances together sometime, I could help you figure out how much it really would cost to get out of Mom and Dad's house and maybe even over here somewhere on the eastern slope.
